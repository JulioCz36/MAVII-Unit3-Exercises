# 🌀 Unit 3 Practice | MAVII

Exercises developed for the first practical assignment of the **MAVII** course. This guide explores advanced physics mechanics using Box2D, including springs, soft interactions, and ragdoll construction.

## ⚙️ Technologies

- C++
- SFML
- Box2D

## 📚 Exercises

### 🏀 Exercise 1 – Bouncing ball

Simulates a ball bouncing off all edges of the screen, applying the elasticity law covered in class. Ideal for understanding the coefficient of restitution and basic collisions.

### 🔗 Exercise 2 – Balls connected by a spring

Two dynamic balls connected by a b2DistanceJoint with a spring effect. The user can grab and move either ball with the mouse.

### 🎯 Exercise 3 – Ball attached to a fixed point

Simulation of a ball attached by a spring to a fixed point in the scene. Demonstrates damping and oscillation behavior.

### 🕹️ Exercise 4 – Player-controlled square

A dynamic square that can be moved by applying forces using the arrow keys. Useful for experimenting with user input, applied forces, and friction.

### 🧍 Exercise 5 – Ragdoll

A physical simulation of a character built from boxes representing the head, torso, arms, and legs. The parts are connected with joints (revolute and distance) to simulate a realistic articulated body.
